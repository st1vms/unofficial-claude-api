## What is this?

This unofficial Python API provides access to the conversational capabilities of Anthropic's Claude AI through a simple chat messaging interface.

While not officially supported by Anthropic, this library can enable interesting conversational applications.

It allows for:

- Creating chat sessions with Claude and getting chat IDs.
- Sending messages to Claude containing up to 5 attachment files (txt, pdf, csv, png, jpeg, etc...) 10 MB each, images are also supported!
- Retrieving chat message history, accessing specific chat conversations.
- Deleting old chats when they are no longer needed.
- Sending requests through proxies.

### Some of the key things you can do with Claude through this API

- Ask questions about a wide variety of topics. Claude can chat about current events, pop culture, sports,
and more.

- Get helpful explanations on complex topics. Ask Claude to explain concepts and ideas in simple terms.

- Generate summaries from long text or documents. Just give the filepath as an attachment to Claude and get back a concise summary.

- Receive thoughtful responses to open-ended prompts and ideas. Claude can brainstorm ideas, expand on concepts, and have philosophical discussions.

- Send images and let Claude analyze them for you.

## How to install

```shell
pip install unofficial-claude-api
```

## Uninstallation

```shell
pip uninstall unofficial-claude-api
```

## Requirements

### These requirements are needed to auto retrieve a SessionData object using selenium

- Python >= 3.10
- Firefox installed, and with at least one profile logged into [Claude](https://claude.ai/chats).
- [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) installed inside a folder registered in PATH environment variable.

***( scrolling through this README you'll find also a manual alternative )***

## Example Usage

```python
from sys import exit as sys_exit
from claude_api.client import (
    ClaudeAPIClient,
    SendMessageResponse,
)
from claude_api.session import SessionData, get_session_data
from claude_api.errors import ClaudeAPIError, MessageRateLimitError, OverloadError

# Wildcard import will also work the same as above
# from claude_api import *

# List of attachments filepaths, up to 5, max 10 MB each
FILEPATH_LIST = ["test.txt"]

# This function will automatically retrieve a SessionData instance using selenium
# It will auto gather cookie session, user agent and organization ID.
# Omitting profile argument will use default Firefox profile
session: SessionData = get_session_data()

# Initialize a client instance using a session
# Optionally change the requests timeout parameter to best fit your needs...default to 240 seconds.
client = ClaudeAPIClient(session, timeout=240)

# Create a new chat and cache the chat_id
chat_id = client.create_chat()
if not chat_id:
    # This will not throw MessageRateLimitError
    # But it still means that account has no more messages left.
    print("\nMessage limit hit, cannot create chat...")
    sys_exit(1)

try:
    # Used for sending message with or without attachments
    # Returns a SendMessageResponse instance
    res: SendMessageResponse = client.send_message(
        chat_id, "Hello!", attachment_paths=FILEPATH_LIST
    )
    # Inspect answer
    if res.answer:
        print(res.answer)
    else:
        # Inspect response status code and raw answer bytes
        print(f"\nError code {res.status_code}, raw_answer: {res.raw_answer}")
except ClaudeAPIError as e:
    # Identify the error
    if isinstance(e, MessageRateLimitError):
        # The exception will hold these informations about the rate limit:
        print(f"\nMessage limit hit, resets at {e.reset_date}")
        print(f"\n{e.sleep_sec} seconds left until -> {e.reset_timestamp}")
    elif isinstance(e, OverloadError):
        print(f"\nOverloaded error: {e}")
    else:
        print(f"\nGot unknown Claude error: {e}")
finally:
    # Perform chat deletion for cleanup
    client.delete_chat(chat_id)

# Get a list of all chats ids
all_chat_ids = client.get_all_chat_ids()
# Delete all chats
for chat in all_chat_ids:
    client.delete_chat(chat)

# Or by using a shortcut utility
client.delete_all_chats()
sys_exit(0)
```

## Tips

### Retrieving chat history

```python
# A convenience method to access a specific chat conversation is
chat_data = client.get_chat_data(chat_id)
```

`chat_data` will be the same json dictionary returned by calling
`/api/organizations/{organization_id}/chat_conversations/{chat_id}`

Here's an example of this json:

```json
{
    "uuid": "<ConversationUUID>",
    "name": "",
    "summary": "",
    "model": null,
    "created_at": "1997-12-25T13:33:33.959409+00:00",
    "updated_at": "1997-12-25T13:33:39.487561+00:00",
    "chat_messages": [
        {
            "uuid": "<MessageUUID>",
            "text": "Who is Bugs Bunny?",
            "sender": "human",
            "index": 0,
            "created_at": "1997-12-25T13:33:39.487561+00:00",
            "updated_at": "1997-12-25T13:33:40.959409+00:00",
            "edited_at": null,
            "chat_feedback": null,
            "attachments": []
        },
        {
            "uuid": "<MessageUUID>",
            "text": "<Claude response's text>",
            "sender": "assistant",
            "index": 1,
            "created_at": "1997-12-25T13:33:40.959409+00:00",
            "updated_at": "1997-12-25T13:33:42.487561+00:00",
            "edited_at": null,
            "chat_feedback": null,
            "attachments": []
        }
    ]
}
```

__________

### Faster loading, avoiding selenium

If for whatever reason you'd like to avoid auto session gathering using selenium,
you just need to manually create a `SessionData` class for `ClaudeAPIClient` constructor, like so...

```python
from claude_api.session import SessionData

cookie_header_value = "The entire Cookie header value string when you visit https://claude.ai/chats"
user_agent = "User agent to use, required"

# You can retrieve this string from /api/organizations endpoint
# If omitted or None it will be auto retrieved when instantiating ClaudeAPIClient
organization_id = "<org_uuid>"

session = SessionData(cookie_header_value, user_agent, organization_id)
```

__________

### Proxies

#### How to set HTTP/S proxies

If you'd like to set an HTTP proxy for all requests, follow this example:

```py
from claude_api.client import HTTPProxy, ClaudeAPIClient
from claude_api.session import SessionData

# Create HTTPProxy instance
http_proxy = HTTPProxy(
    "the.proxy.ip.addr",    # Proxy IP
    8080,                   # Proxy port
    "username",             # Proxy Username (optional)
    "password",             # Proxy Password (optional)
    use_ssl=False           # Set to True if proxy uses HTTPS schema
)

session = SessionData(...)

# Give the proxy instance to ClaudeAPIClient constructor, along with session data.
client = ClaudeAPIClient(session, proxy=http_proxy)
```

#### How to set SOCKS proxies

If you want to opt for SOCKS proxies instead, the procedure is the same, but you need to import the `SOCKSProxy` class instead, configuring it with the version number.

```py
from claude_api.client import SOCKSProxy, ClaudeAPIClient
from claude_api.session import SessionData

# Create SOCKSProxy instance
socks_proxy = SOCKSProxy(
    "the.proxy.ip.addr",    # Proxy IP
    8080,                   # Proxy port
    "username",             # Proxy Username (optional)
    "password",             # Proxy Password (optional)
    version_num=5           # Either 4 or 5, defaults to 4
)

session = SessionData(...)

# Give the proxy instance to ClaudeAPIClient constructor as usual
client = ClaudeAPIClient(session, proxy=socks_proxy)
```

__________

### Changing Claude model

In case you'd like to change the model used, or you do have accounts that are unable to migrate to latest model, you can override the `model_name` string parameter of `ClaudeAPIClient` constructor like so:

```py
from claude_api.client import ClaudeAPIClient
from claude_api.session import SessionData

session = SessionData(...)

# Defaults to None (latest Claude model)
client = ClaudeAPIClient(session, model_name="claude-2.0")
```

You can retrieve the `model_name` strings from the [official API docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/models-overview#model-comparison)

__________

### Changing Organization

As reported in issue [#23](https://github.com/st1vms/unofficial-claude-api/issues/23)
if you're encountering 403 errors when using Selenium to auto retrieve a `SessionData` class and your account has multiple organizations,
you may want to override the default organization retrieved.

By default `get_session_data` retrieves the last organization from the result array found [here](https://claude.ai/api/organizations).
You can override the index to fetch by using parameter `organization_index`:

```py
from claude_api.session import get_session_data

# Defaults to -1 (last entry)
session = get_session_data(organization_index=-1)
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

Some common errors that may arise during the usage of this API:

- *Error [400]* (Unable to prepare file attachment):

    To fix this error, change the extension of the attachment file to something like .txt, since by default this api will fallback to octet-stream for unknown file extensions, Claude may reject the file data.

- *Error [403]*:

    \****This bug should be already fixed after version 0.2.2***\*

    This api will sometime return a 403 status_code when calling `send_message`, when this happens it is recommeded to look for these things:

    Check if your IP location is allowed, should be in US/UK, other locations may work sporadically.

    Don't try to send the same prompt/file over and over again, instead wait for some time, and change input.
